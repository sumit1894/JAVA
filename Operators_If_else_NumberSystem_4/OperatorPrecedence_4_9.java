//? Unary operators: ++ -- + - ~ !
//? Multiplicative operators: * / %
//? Additive operators: + -
//? Shift operators: << >> >>>
//? Relational operators: < > <= >= instanceof
//? Equality operators: == !=
//? Bitwise AND: &

//? Bitwise OR: |

//? Assignment operators: = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

//! Associativity: Defines the order of operation for operators with the same precedence, usually left-to-right or right-to-left.

//? Left-to-right: + - * / % << >> >>> & | && || = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=
//? Right-to-left: ++ -- ! ~
