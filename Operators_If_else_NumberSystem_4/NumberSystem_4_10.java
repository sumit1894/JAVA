        // ? Decimal Number System is a base-10 system that has ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
        // ? • The decimal number system is said to be of base, or radix, 10 because it uses 10 digits and the coefficients are multiplied by powers of 10.
        // ? • This is the base that we often use in our day to day life.
        // ? • Example: (7,392)10 , where 7,392 is a shorthand notation for what should be written as
        // ? 7 * 103 + 3 * 102 + 9 * 101 + 2 * 100


        // ! Binary Number System

        // ? Binary Number System is a base-2 system that has two digits: 0, 1.
        // ? • The binary number system is said to be of base, or radix, 2 because it uses 2 digits and the coefficients are multiplied by powers of 2.
        // ? • This is the base that is used in digital systems.
        // ? • Example: (1011)2 , where 1011 is a shorthand notation for what should be written as
        // ? 1 * 23 + 0 * 22 + 1 * 21 + 1 * 20 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
